In this case, we want to grab the EMNIST \"letters\" dataset, which is made up of 145,600 28x28 pixel (or 784 pixels in total) images of letters. Each pixel is a grayscale value between 0 and 255. To make it easier for the neural network to process, we divide each value by 255 to get to a number between 0 and 1 for each pixel in each image. Performing a transformation like this to make the data easier to process in a machine learning method is called pre-processing.  Different pre-processing steps may be required for different types of data. \n",

In this case, we'll use the first 60,000 pictures as our training set and then we'll use the following 10,000 pictures as our testing set (and use them to ask the network to check how well it has learned). This is a bit of an arbitrary decision, but based on our experience, this is large enough of a sample (more will just take longer to process but won't improve accuracy of the model) --- but don't take our word for it, you can play around with the training and testing sample on your own. Just remember to always keep the two samples separate.\n",

    "We can definitely pick out more of the words! There are still some mistakes because our neural network accuracy wasn't 100%, so we would expect to see about the same rate of error here (maybe even a bit more, since these letters were originally created at a very different size). But, looking at the context and knowing which letters are likely to be mistaken for one another, we can still read the story.\n",

That's because once a network is trained, it's not really random anymore -- it's always applying the same math to the pixels to make its prediction. To get a different prediction, you have to rerun the code above where you trained mlp2.\n",
